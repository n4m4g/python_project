    >>> What is this pattern about?
    The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated the
    same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of
    a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent
    part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients
    treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
    >>> What does this example do?
    The example implements a graphic classï¼Œwhich can be either an ellipse
    or a composition of several graphics. Every graphic can be printed.
