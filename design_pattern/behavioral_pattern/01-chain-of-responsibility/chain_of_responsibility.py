    >>> What is this pattern about?
    The Chain of responsibility is an object oriented version of the
    `if ... elif ... elif ... else ...` idiom, with the
    benefit that the conditionâ€“action blocks can be dynamically rearranged
    and reconfigured at runtime.

    This pattern aims to decouple the senders of a request from its
    receivers by allowing request to move through chained
    receivers until it is handled.

    Request receiver in simple form keeps a reference to a single successor.
    As a variation some receivers may be capable of sending requests out
    in several directions, forming a `tree of responsibility`.

    >>> TL;DR
    Allow a request to pass down a chain of receivers until it is handled.
