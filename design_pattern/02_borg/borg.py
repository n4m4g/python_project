    >>> What is this pattern about?
    a way to implement singleton behavior, but instead of
    having only one instance of a class, there are multiple
    instances that share the same state.
    In other words, the focus is on sharing state
    instead of sharing instance identity.

    >>> What does this example do?
    In Python, instance attributes are stored in a
    attribute dictionary called __dict__.
    Usually, each instance will have its own dictionary,
    but the Borg pattern modifies this so that all
    instances have the same dictionary.

    The __shared_state attribute will be the dictionary
    shared between all instances, and this is ensured by assigining
    __shared_state to the __dict__ variable when initializing a new
    instance (i.e., in the __init__ method).
    Other attributes are usually added to the instance's attribute
    dictionary, but, since the attribute dictionary itself is
    shared (which is __shared_state), all other attributes will also be shared.
